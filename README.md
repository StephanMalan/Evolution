SoftwareEvolution

Software Evolution is a project developed in my free time to get familiar with neural networks.

The program creates a random organism following set constraints which is then released on a 2D canvas to search for food.
The program creates and tests multiple random organisms before selecting the best performers and cloning and mutating offspring

The aim is for natrual selection to evolve the organisms

Currently it has created organisms that can actively find food using sensor on a 2D pane
